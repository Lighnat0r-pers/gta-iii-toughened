Thanks for installing GTA III Toughened!

As a reminder, this mod does not replace any existing files so you run both the mod and the base game from the same folder without interfering. Launch the base game from "gta3.exe", the mod from "GTA III Toughened.exe".

To check for updates, run "GTA III Toughened Update Checker.exe" located in the game folder. Keep in mind that new versions are most likely not savegame compatible.

Have fun! ;)



(Don't forget to keep an eye out for secrets in some of the missions)
